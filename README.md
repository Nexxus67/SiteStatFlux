# SiteStatFlux
This script generates a report of site usage based on the Nginx access log file located at /var/log/nginx/access.log (or the location specified in the code). The report includes the total number of requests, number of unique IP addresses, the top 10 most frequently requested pages, and the average request size. The report data is written to a file named site_usage_report.txt (or the file location specified in the code) and displayed on the terminal.
